Stroking a self-intersecting path generates the wrong answer, (in
mostly subtle ways). The fix is to tessellate a giant polygon for the
entire stroke outline rather than incrementally generating trapezoids.

Cairo is crashing Xnest with the following message:

X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  72 (X_PutImage)
  Serial number of failed request:  28
  Current serial number in output stream:  29

confirmed on a quite default install of debian unstable.
