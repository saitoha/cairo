The polygon tessellation routine has problems. It appears that the
following paper has the right answers:

	[Hobby93c] John D. Hobby, Practical Segment Intersection with
	Finite Precision Output, Computation Geometry Theory and
	Applications, 13(4), 1999.

Recent improvements to make the intersection code more robust (using
128-bit arithmetic where needed), have exposed some of the weakness in
the current tessellation implementation. So, for now, filling some
polygons will cause "leaking" until we implement Hobby's algorithm.
