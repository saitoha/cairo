Better text support
-------------------
This snapshot provides much better text support by implementing the
following four functions:

        cairo_text_extents
        cairo_glyph_extents
        cairo_text_path
        cairo_glyph_path

The text/glyph_extents functions can be used to determine the bounding
box (and advance) for text as if drawn by show_text/glyphs.

The text/glyph_path objects functions place text shapes on the current
path, where they can be subsequently manipulated. For example,
following these functions with cairo_stroke allows outline text to be
drawn. Calling cairo_clip allows clipping to a text-shaped region.

Combined dependencies
---------------------
The cairo core now depends only on the libpixman library. This single
library replaces the three previous libraries libic, libpixregion, and
slim. Thanks to Dave Beckett <dave.beckett@bristol.ac.uk> for all of
the heavy lifting with this renaming effort.

Conditional compilation of backends
-----------------------------------
Cairo now allows optional beckends to be disabled at compile time. The
following options may now be passed to the configure script:

	--disable-xlib
	--disable-ps

Note that the first option is a change from the old --without-x option
which will no longer have any effect.

OS X supported - several byte-order issues resolved
---------------------------------------------------
Cairo has now been successfully compiled under OS X. Testing revealed
that there were some byte-order problems in the PostScript backend and
the PNG generation in the demos. These have now been resolved.
