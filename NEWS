---------------------------------------------------
This snapshot provides much better text support by implementing the
following four functions:

	cairo_text_extents
	cairo_glyph_extents
	cairo_text_path
	cairo_glyph_path

The text/glyph_extents functions can be used to determine the bounding
box (and advance) for text as if drawn by show_text/glyphs.

The text/glyph_path objects functions place text shapes on the current
path, where they can be subsequently manipulated. For example,
following these functions with cairo_stroke allows outline text to be
drawn. Calling cairo_clip allows clipping to a text-shaped region.
