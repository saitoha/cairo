cairo 1.0.4? bug fixes (I don't know if this release will be needed
or not, but I wanted a place to lodge a bug that slipped from 1.0.2
===================================================================
For each bug number XXXX below, see:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXX
 4630  Fonts too large when drawing to image surface while printing
 4863  stroking problems with wide dashed lines 

cairo 1.2.0 essential features (targeted for 2006-01-13)
The release won't happen without these being complete.
========================================================
 A. PS backend
    ----------
    ✓1. Mark PS backend as supported:

	✓a. Incorporate into test suite

	✓b. Correct output for the entire test suite
	    ✓clip-operator
	    ✓composite-integer-translate-source
	    ✓linear-gradient
	    ✓operator-clear
	    ✓operator-source
	    ✓self-copy
	    ✓text-pattern
	    ✓trap-clip
	    ✓unbounded-operator

     2. Image fallbacks at finer-than-whole-page granularity

 B. PDF backend
    -----------
     1. Mark PDF backend as supported

	✓a. Incorporate into test suite

	 b. Correct output for the entire test suite (use image
	    fallbacks as necessary, meta-surface?):

	      a. Gradients with more than two stops

	      b. All of the cairo_operator_t modes

	      c. Gradients with transparency

	      d. Repeating surface patterns

	      e. cairo_mask

 E. Fix memory leaks
    ----------------
     1. Ensure 'make check-valgrind' passes with no leaks

cairo 1.2.0 desired features (targeted for 2006-01-13)
If these aren't ready, they won't be in the release.
[There are some bugs that need to be added here, and
 some bugs that should be bumped up into the essential
 features section.]
======================================================

 C. Win32 backend
    -------------
    ✓1. Incorporate into test suite

     2. Correct output for the entire suite
	 a. self-copy
	 b. trap-clip

	 [There is some mailing-list discussion about possible fixes
	 for these.]

 D. Bug fixes
    ---------
    ✓1. Fix dashed splines.

     2. Fix some expected failures (XFAIL) in the test suite

	 a. a8-mask

	✓b. clip-all

	 c. filter-nearest-offset

	 d. pixman-rotate

	 e. extend-reflect

 E. API Additions
    -------------
     1. cairo_begin/end/get_group
	Status: cworth has a posted a preliminary patch, and keithp,
		krh, and otaylor answered all the tough questions it
		raised. There's not much work left to finish this one.
		Vladimir Vukicevic has taken up the torch on this and
		has posted an almost-complete set of patches.

    2. The pango developers need one or two additions in order to
       implement pango's hex-box drawing.

	 5496 Add getters for cairo_scaled_font_t
	      - This looks trivial, and is maybe "enough" for an ugly
		solution in pango.
	      
	 5495 Need cairo_scaled_font_text_extents
	      - I think I would actually prefer to add
                cairo_text_to_glyphs for this fix.

 F. Performance improvements
    ------------------------
     1. Cull and trim trapezoids outside clip region bounds

     2. Generate more large pixel-aligned, rectangular trapezoids

    ✓3. Speed up glyph measurement (cache rewrite)

    ✓4. Speed up gradient computations

 G. SVG backend
    -----------
    ✓1. Add experimental SVG backend

cairo 1.4.0 desired features (Schedule unknown)
===============================================
 A. Quartz backend (maintainer needed!)
    -----------------------------------
     1. Mark Quartz backend as supported:

	 a. Incorporate into test suite

	 b. Correct output for the entire suite

 B. SVG backend
    -----------
     1. Mark SVG backend as supported

	 a. Incorporate into test suite

	 b. Correct output for the entire suite

 B. Performance improvements
    ------------------------
     1. New tessellator (more robust and faster)

 C. Bug fixes
    ---------
     1. Fix all expected failures (XFAIL) in the test suite

	 a. self-intersecting
		AKA. https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3752
		Fix depends on [A1].
