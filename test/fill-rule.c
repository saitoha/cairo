/* Bug history
 *
 * 2004-10-27  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   There's currently a regression bug in the tessellation code. This
 *   causes each of these simple star shapes to be filled incorrectly.
 *
 *   It looks like right now we can get this test to pass by doing:
 *
 *       cvs update -r 1.16 src/cairo_traps.c
 *
 *   But we don't want to revert that change permanently since it
 *   really does correct some bugs. It must be that the old version of
 *   the code is masking some other bugs in the tessellation code. My
 *   current plan is to back this revision up for the next snapshot,
 *   but not to list the test as an expected failure since I'm
 *   planning on doing the new tessellator which should fix this
 *   problem.
 *
