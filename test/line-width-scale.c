/* This test exercises the various interactions between
 * cairo_set_line_width and cairo_scale. Specifically it show how
 * separate transformations can affect the pen for stroking compared
 * to the path itself.
 *
 * This was inspired by an image by Maxim Shemanarev demonstrating the
 * flexible-pipeline nature of his Antigrain Geometry project:
 *
 *	http://antigrain.com/tips/line_alignment/conv_order.gif
 *
 * It also uncovered a bug in cairo that cairo_set_line_width was not
 * transforing the width according the the current CTM, but instead
 * delaying that transformation until the time of cairo_stroke. See:
 *
