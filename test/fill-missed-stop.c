/* Bug history
 *
 * 2006-12-05  M Joonas Pihlaja <jpihlaja@cc.helsinki.fi>
 *
 *  The tessellator has a regression where a trapezoid may continue
 *  below the end of a polygon edge (i.e. the bottom of the trapezoid
 *  is miscomputed.)  This can only happen if the right edge of a
 *  trapezoid stops earlier than the left edge and there is no start
 *  event at the end point of the right edge.
