Build fixes for cygwin
----------------------
This snapshot adds the -no-undefined flag during compilation which is
necessart for building a shared library under cygwin.

Cleanup of the public API
-------------------------
We recently noticed that there were a coupld of bugs in the script
that renamed libic to libpixman. Fixing this requires the following
changes in the public API:

	PIXMAN_FORMAT_AR_GB32 -> PIXMAN_FORMAT_ARGB32
	PIXMAN_FORMAT_RG_B24 -> PIXMAN_FORMAT_RGB24

While we're changing that, we also normalized the names of structure
tags, for example:

	struct _pixman_region16_t -> struct pixman_region16
	etc.

but users are expected to use typedefs such as pixman_region16_t
anyway.
