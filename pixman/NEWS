Snapshot 0.1.2 (2004-10-13 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
New functionality
-----------------
Added three new functions:

	pixman_image_set_component_alpha
	pixman_format_get_masks
	pixman_image_get_format

The first enables component-alpha compositing which can be used for
optimizing sub-pixel rendering of text and other geometry. This is
useful when the geometrical relationship of the sub-pixel components
of the display device are known, (eg. with flat-panel monitors rather
than CRTs).

The other two functions are simple query functions that were missing.

Bug fixes
---------
Enabling transform and repeat together now works.
Endian-ness fixes.
Memory mismanagement fixes.

Snapshot 0.1.1 (2004-04-16 Carl Worth <cworth@east.isi.edu>)
============================================================
Build fixes for cygwin
----------------------
This snapshot adds the -no-undefined flag during compilation which is
necessart for building a shared library under cygwin.

Cleanup of the public API
-------------------------
We recently noticed that there were a coupld of bugs in the script
that renamed libic to libpixman. Fixing this requires the following
changes in the public API:

	PIXMAN_FORMAT_AR_GB32 -> PIXMAN_FORMAT_ARGB32
	PIXMAN_FORMAT_RG_B24 -> PIXMAN_FORMAT_RGB24

While we're changing that, we also normalized the names of structure
tags, for example:

	struct _pixman_region16_t -> struct pixman_region16
	etc.

but users are expected to use typedefs such as pixman_region16_t
anyway.
