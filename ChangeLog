	* Remove infinite looping when stroking with a line width at or
	close to 0.0. Thanks to Rob Buis <buis@kde.org> and Noah Levitt
	<nlevitt@columbia.edu> for providing in-the-wild examples of SVG
	files with stroke-width:0 that demonstrated the problem,
	(cowboy.svg and albania.svg).

	* src/cairo_pen.c (_cairo_pen_stroke_spline): Do nothing if the
	pen is a degenerate, single point. This happens when the line
	width is a very small, non-zero value.

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_stroke): Do nothing when asked
	to stroke a path with a line_width of 0.0. Previously, this would
	lead to an infinite loop.

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_set_line_width): Force negative line width
	to 0.0.

	* TODO: Updated TODO list.

2003-11-10  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* configure.in: Fix typo (thanks to John Ellson
	<ellson@research.att.com>)

	(cairo_in_fill): Added new cairo_in_stroke and cairo_in_fill.

	* src/cairo_traps.c (_cairo_trap_contains):
	(_cairo_traps_contain): * src/cairo_gstate.c
	(_cairo_gstate_in_stroke):
	(_cairo_gstate_in_fill): New functions to support for
	cairo_in_stroke and cairo_in_fill. Many thanks to Thomas Hunger
	<info@teh-web.de> for the initial implementation which
	demonstrated how easy this would be and pushed me to go and write
	it already.

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_clip_and_composite_trapezoids):
	* src/cairo_traps.c (_line_segs_intersect_ceil): 
	* src/cairo_path.c (_cairo_path_move_to):
	(_cairo_path_line_to):
	(_cairo_path_curve_to): Fixed to use _cairo_fixed_from_double
	instead of XDoubleToFixed.

2003-11-06  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_current_font): Move declaration to beginning
	of function to avoid requiring a C99-compatible compiler.

	* src/cairo.h: Add comment pondering memory management semantics
	of cairo_current_target_surface.

	* src/cairo_pen.c (_cairo_pen_fini): NULL out pen->vertices after

	(_cairo_image_abstract_surface_destroy): NULL out durface->data
	after free.

2003-11-04  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_set_target_surface): Enable
	cairo_set_target_surface (cr, NULL) to work. This can be useful to
	force the current target surface to be finalized.

	* configure.in: 
	* cairo.pc.in (Requires): Add explicit fontconfig and freetype2
	dependencies that were implicitly dropped along with Xft.

2003-11-04  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* TODO: Note that cairo_show_page, cairo_copy_page, PostScript
	backend, "real" text API, and text support for the image backend
	have now all been implemented.

2003-11-04  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* configure.in:
	* cairo.pc.in (Requires): cairo doesn't depend on Xft after the
	recent text work.

2003-11-03  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* configure.in (CAIRO_VERSION): Bump version to 0.1.11 for new
	cairo_copy_page.

	* src/cairo_ps_surface.c (cairo_ps_surface_create): Now print
	header at time of surface_create rather than in show_page.
	(_cairo_ps_surface_destroy): Print document footer at time of
	surface_destroy rather than in show_page.
	(_cairo_ps_surface_erase): New function for sharing.
	(_cairo_ps_surface_copy_page): Now keep proper page count.
	(_cairo_ps_surface_show_page): Real work is now done in
	copy_page. show_page is only distinct in that it erases the
	surface afterwards.

	* src/cairo.h: 
	* src/cairo.c (cairo_copy_page):
	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_copy_page): 
	* src/cairo_surface.c (_cairo_surface_copy_page):
	* src/cairo_image_surface.c (_cairo_image_surface_copy_page): 
	* src/cairo_xlib_surface.c (_cairo_xlib_surface_copy_page): Add
	support for new cairo_copy_page function.

2003-11-03  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_ps_surface.c (cairo_set_target_ps): Add missing check
	for out of memory.

	* src/cairo_image_surface.c
	(_cairo_image_surface_create_with_masks):
	(_cairo_image_surface_create_with_masks):
	(cairo_image_surface_create):
	(cairo_image_surface_create):
	(cairo_image_surface_create_for_data):
	(cairo_image_surface_create_for_data): Add several missing checks

2003-11-03  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairo.h: Added __external_linkage to a few functions that
	were missing it.

2003-11-01  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_ps_surface.c (_cairo_ps_surface_show_page): Fix
	misplacement of PS origin, (was translating vertically by width
	instead of height).

	* configure.in (CAIRO_VERSION): Bumped version to 0.1.10 for new
	functions cairo_set_target_ps, cairo_ps_surface_create, and
	cairo_show_page.

	* src/cairo_ps_surface.c: New file with preliminary support for
	drawing to a PostScript file. Most of the ps_surface backend
	functions are just tiny wrappers, deferring to image_surface
	functions to do the real work. Then, in show_page, the image is
	compressed and spit out into the file. Crude and effective.

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_show_page):
	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_show_page):
	* src/cairo_image_surface (_cairo_image_surface_show_page):
	* src/cairo_xlib_surface.c (_cairo_xlib_surface_show_page): 
	* src/cairo_surface.c (_cairo_surface_show_page): Implement new
	support for cairo_show_page -- just a stub in the non-PS surfaces.

	* src/cairo_image_surface.c (_cairo_image_surface_set_filter):
	Export this function for internal use.

	* src/cairo.h: Added cairo_set_target_ps, cairo_ps_surface_create,
	and cairo_show_page. Noted plans for new cairo_surface_clip_begin,
	perhaps moving some cairo_surface functions to cairo_set_pattern,
	and possibly renaming cairo_matrix_t to cairo_transform_t.
	
	* src/Makefile.am (libcairo_la_SOURCES): Added cairo_ps_surface.c.

2003-10-31  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_arc):
	(_cairo_gstate_arc_negative): Do nothing when radius <= 0.0,
	(which is much better than the current infinite loop).

2003-10-31  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* Moved all libic-related drawing into cairo_image_surface.c.
	Details below:

	* src/cairo_xlib_surface.c: Add width, height, format to
	cairo_xlib_surface_t.
	(_cairo_xlib_surface_get_image):

	interface instead of pull_image/push_image.
	(_cairo_xlib_surface_get_image): Fix memory leak that showed up
	with non-Render servers.
	(_cairo_xlib_surface_set_matrix): Implement set_matrix with new
	interface.
	(_render_operator): Translate from cairo_operator_t to
	Render-defined operator values rather than assuming they are the
	same.

	* src/cairo_surface.c: Move all libic-related code into
	cairo_image_surface.c. cairo_surface is now a thin wrapper around
	concrete surface types, (with fallback code to cairo_image_surface
	whenever a backend does not provide support for a particular
	function). Remove checks for NULL backend functions.
	(_cairo_surface_get_image):
	(_cairo_surface_set_image): New interface to replace
	pull_image/push_image. Now uses a cairo_image_surface rather than
	an IcImage and now also passes it externally rather than storing
	it in the surface.

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_fini):
	(_cairo_gstate_set_target_surface):
	(_cairo_gstate_set_rgb_color): Avoid useless calls to
	cairo_surface_destroy for NULL surfaces.
	(_cairo_gstate_show_surface): 
	(_cairo_gstate_clip): 
	(_cairo_gstate_clip_and_composite_trapezoids):
	(_cairo_gstate_begin_group): Add status checking for calls to
	surface_create_similar, surface_fill_rectangles,
	surface_composite, and surface_composite_trapezoids.

	* src/cairo_ft_font.c (_cairo_ft_font_show_glyphs): Remove one
	gratuitous level of nesting.
	(_cairo_ft_font_show_glyphs): Bubble up NULL_MEMORY status.

	* src/cairo.h: Portability improvements: Remove include of
	X11/extensions/Xrender.h. Move include down near the freetype
	include.
	cairo_format_t: Eliminate Render-based values for this enum.
	cairo_operator_t: Eliminate Render-based values. Drop
	disjoint/conjoint operators.
	cairo_filter_t: Eliminate libic-based values for this enum.
	Add cairo_image_surface_create and cairo_image_surface_create_for_data.

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_status_string): Add new CAIRO_STATUS_NULL_POINTER.
	This can be returned only if the user passes a NULL object in to a
	cairo function.

	* src/cairoint.h: Move include of <X11/extensions/Xrender.h> from
	cairo.h to here.

	* src/Makefile.am (libcairo_la_SOURCES): Add
	cairo_image_surface.c. Reformat line continuation characters.

	* src/cairoint.h: Remove prototypes for obsolete functions:
	_cairo_gstate_set_visual and _cairo_gstate_set_format.

2003-10-30  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_xlib_surface.c (_cairo_xlib_surface_destroy): Fix
	memory leaks of surface->gc and surface->ximage.
	(_cairo_xlib_surface_composite):
	(_cairo_xlib_surface_composite_trapezoids): Fix memory leaks of
	cloned surfaces.

2003-10-30  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* configure.in (CAIRO_VERSION): Bumped version to 0.1.9 for change
	in argument list of cairo_ft_font_create.

	* src/cairo_ft_font.c: A set of changes to eliminate the static
	FT_Library field, (which could introduce nasty problems with
	respect to threading). With the new code, each font created with
	the toy API will own its own FT_Library. Meanwhile,
	cairo_ft_font_create now accepts an FT_Library parameter.

	* src/cairo_ft_font.c: Add ft_library field so that fonts that own
	their own FT_Library can also clean it up.  Eliminate static
	FT_Library and _init_cairo_ft_lib.
	(cairo_ft_font_create): Now accepts an FT_Library argument.
	(_cairo_ft_font_create): Create an FT_Library owned by this font,
	(this only happens as part of the "toy API")
	(_cairo_ft_font_destroy): Clean up ft_font->ft_library if
	necessary.
	(cairo_ft_font_create_for_ft_face): Initialize ft_library and
	owns_ft_library.

	(_cairo_gstate_fini):
	(_cairo_gstate_select_font):
	(_cairo_gstate_set_font): Replace calls to _cairo_font_fini with
	cairo_font_destroy.

	* src/cairo_ft_font.c (_cairo_ft_font_destroy): Rename
	_cairo_ft_font_close to _cairo_ft_font_destroy.

	* src/cairo_font.c: Eliminate unnecessary cairo_font_fini
	function.
	(cairo_font_destroy): Put reference decerement here where it
	belongs.

	* src/cairoint.h: Eliminate unnecessart family, slant, and weight
	fields from cairo_font_t.
	Rname font backend->close to backend->destroy.

	gstate->pixels_per_inch. Swithc from default 3780 pixels per meter
	to 96.0 pixels per inch which is slightly different.

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_ensure_source):
	(_cairo_gstate_clip_and_composite_trapezoids):

	(_cairo_gstate_show_surface): Track changes to
	_cairo_surface_create_similar_solid.

	* src/cairo_surface.c (_cairo_surface_create_similar_solid): Now
	that this function is internal, it can accept a cairo_color_t
	which makes the interface much cleaner.

	* src/cairo.h: Remove problematic function
	cairo_surface_create_similar_solid from the public API.

2003-10-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_surface.c (_cairo_surface_composite):

	the virtual surface.

2003-10-27  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_ft_font.c (_cairo_ft_font_create): Default to normal
	slant/weight on out-of-range values.
	Add missing include of fontconfig/fcfreetype.h.

2003-10-24  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	(_cairo_gstate_current_font): gstate->font must never be NULL.
	(_cairo_gstate_current_font_extents): Can never be called with a
	NULL gstate.

	for the reminder).

2003-10-09  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	functions to get/set current path.

2003-09-16  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_surface.c (cairo_surface_create_similar_solid): Fixed
	massive pixmap leak, (at least one pixmap for every set_rgb_color)

	* configure.in (CAIRO_VERSION): Bumped to 0.1.3 for new functions:
	cairo_reference and cairo_surface_reference.

	* src/cairo_surface.c (cairo_surface_reference): Export
	cairo_surface_reference.

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_reference): Add new function to increase
	reference count of cairo_t.
	(cairo_create):
	(cairo_copy):
	(cairo_destroy): Make these functions aware of the new reference
	count.

2003-09-15  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* configure.in: Require xrender >= 0.6.0

	* src/cairo_surface.c (_cairo_x11_surface_put_image): Make static.

2003-09-15  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_restore): Fix to catch invalid restore rather
	than just catching the second invalid restore. Fix from Keith
	Packard <keithp@keithp.com>.

2003-09-12  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_surface.c (cairo_surface_create_similar_solid): Don't
	try to create depth-32 pixmaps on non-Render servers.

	* src/cairo_surface.c (_create_icformat_for_visual):
	(_create_icformat_for_format): Updates for new libic interface.
	(cairo_x11_surface_put_image): Rename cairo_surface_put_image to
	cairo_x11_surface_put_image.
	(_cairo_surface_pull_image):
	(_cairo_surface_push_image): First real implementation of
	push/pull_image, (thanks for help from Graydon Hoare
	<graydon@redhat.com>). This provides support for running Cairo on
	X servers that do not have the RENDER extension. (Note: This is
	still woefully slow).

	* src/cairo_path_stroke.c (_cairo_stroker_join): Switch to
	_cairo_fixed functions.

	* src/cairo_path_bounds.c (_cairo_path_bounds): Use cairo_fixed
	rather than X macros.

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_current_point): If not
	explicitly set, current point is (0,0) in user space.
	(_cairo_gstate_show_text): Fix to place text at user-space origin
	if there is no current point.
	(_cairo_gstate_show_surface): Optimize to pass NULL mask if alpha
	== 1.0.

	than (0,0).

	* src/cairo.h: Removed cairo_surface_put_image.

	* src/Makefile.am (libcairo_la_SOURCES): Added cairo_fixed.c

2003-09-05  Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>

	* src/cairo_path_stroke.c: comment face computations, check for
	reflecting transformation to select correct face orientations
	
	* src/cairo_pen.c: check for reflecting transform when computing
	pen to ensure consistent pen orientation

2003-09-05  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 0.1.2 for new cairo_copy
	function.

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_init): Fixed uninitialized
	current_pt values.
	(_cairo_gstate_clone): Force gstate->next to NULL after cloning,
	to prevent the clone from trashing the former stack.

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_create): Folded _cairo_init into cairo_create.
	(cairo_destroy): Folded _cairo_fini into cairo_dstroy.
	(cairo_copy): Added new cairo_copy function.

2003-09-05  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_show_text): Fix crash due to
	missing call to ensure_source.

2003-09-04  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairoint.h (DEPRECATE): Changed DEPRECATE mechanism to
	preseve binary compatibility, but break source-level
	compatibility.

2003-09-04  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_init): Combine gstate->pattern
	and gstate->solid into a single gstate->source.
	(_cairo_gstate_set_rgb_color): Defer creation of gstate->source
	until the stroke or fill.
	(_cairo_gstate_ensure_source): New function to combine duplicated
	code.
	(_cairo_gstate_stroke):
	(_cairo_gstate_fill): Now must ensure that gstate->source has been
	created.

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_set_target_surface):
	(cairo_set_target_drawable):
	(cairo_set_target_image): These functions can now clear
	status==CAIRO_STATUS_NO_TARGET_SURFACE. This is a clean solution
	to the bug of a SEGV if cairo_stroke/cairo_fill are called before
	cairo_set_target.

	* BUGS: Removed two fixed bugs, (SEGV if cairo_set_rgb_color
	called before cairo_set_target and SEGV if cairo_fill called
	before cairo_set_rgb_color)

2003-09-04  Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>

	* src/cairo_path_stroke.c: added comments describing miter
	join code and miter limit computation.  Replace XFoo with cairo_foo
	for double and fixed

	* src/cairoint.h: add cairo_fixed_to_double and cairo_double_to_fixed
	Carl says he's got similar code, so he'll have to fix things if I
	get this committed quickly enough.

2003-09-04  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* util/cairo-api-update: Added script to update source code using
	Cairo to the latest API.

	* configure.in (CAIRO_VERSION): Bumped version to 0.1.1

	* src/cairoint.h (DEPRECATE): Added magic DEPRECATE macro which
	provides an asm-based alias for old function names. This works on
	ELF systems with gcc version >= 2.

	* src/cairo.h (cairo_get_status_string): Deprecated all
	cairo_get_* names in favor of cairo_current_*. The deprecated
	function names will trigger either a warning or a link error, but
	in both cases with a useful message giving both the old and new
	name of the function. Three of the function name changes are
	different than the single word substituion:
		cairo_get_current_color	-> cairo_current_color
		cairo_get_status	-> cairo_status
		cairo_get_status_string	-> cairo_status_string
	
2003-09-03  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairo.h: Change cairo_get_matrix interface to accept a
	cairo_matrix_t* rather than 6 double*.

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_get_matrix): Add implementation of cairo_get_matrix.

2003-08-29  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_surface.c (_cairo_surface_composite): Optimized case
	where src is in memory, dst is on server, and mask is NULL. Will
	now do a single XPutImage rather than the painful
	GetImage/PutImage dance of the general code.

2003-08-28  Carl Worth  <cworth at east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_traps.c (_line_segs_intersect_ceil): One more
	increment, (that still won't fix the bug). Added comment point to
	Hobby's paper, (that will fix it).

	* src/cairo_font.c (_cairo_font_resolve_xft_font): Fixed to use
	fabs instead of abs when correcting for negative area expansion.

2003-08-28  Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com
	* src/cairo_font.c: font pixel size is always non-negative

2003-08-26  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairoint.h: Added missing underscores to several internal
	functions.
	* src/cairo_font.c: 
	* src/cairo_gstate.c: 
	* src/cairo_matrix.c: 
	* src/cairo_path_fill.c: 
	* src/cairo_path_stroke.c: 
	* src/cairo_pen.c: 
	* src/cairo_traps.c: Fixed to track newly added underscores.

	pattern at current point instead of the origin.
	(_cairo_gstate_stroke): Fixed to properly transform pattern.
	(_cairo_gstate_fill): Fixed to properly transform pattern.

2003-07-31  Richard Henderson  <rth@twiddle.net>

	* src/cairo_color.c (CAIRO_COLOR_DEFAULT): Mark const.
	* src/cairo_matrix.c (CAIRO_MATRIX_IDENTITY): Likewise.
	* src/cairo_path.c (num_args): Likewise.
	* src/cairo_path_bounds.c (_cairo_path_bounds): Likewise for cb.

2003-07-31  Richard Henderson  <rth@twiddle.net>

	* cairo.pc.in: Depend on slim.
	* configure.in: Check for slim.

	* src/cairo.h: Include slim_{export,import}.h as needed; mark all
	symbols __external_linkage.
	* src/cairoint.h: Include slim_internal.h; mark all symbols
	__internal_linkage.  Provide slim_hidden_proto symbols as needed.
	* src/cairo.c, src/cairo_matrix.c, src/cairo_surface.c,
	Provide slim_hidden_def symbols as needed.
	* src/cairo_traps.c (cairo_traps_add_trap): Mark static.
	(cairo_traps_add_trap_from_points): Likewise.

2003-07-30  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* configure.in (LIBIC_REQUIRED): Fixed some typos in the libic
	PKG_CHECK.

	* src/cairoint.h: 
	* src/cairo.c: Fixed a disagreement over whether some internal
	cairo_gstate_t functions had an '_' prefix or not.

	* src/cairo_traps.c (_line_segs_intersect_ceil): Add one more
	conditional intersect to push past some fill bugs.

	* src/cairo_surface.c (cairo_surface_create_for_drawable):
	(cairo_surface_create_for_image):
	(cairo_surface_put_image):
	(_cairo_surface_pull_image):
	(_cairo_surface_push_image):
	(cairo_surface_set_matrix):
	(cairo_surface_get_matrix):
	(cairo_surface_set_repeat):
	(_cairo_surface_composite):
	(_cairo_surface_fill_rectangle):
	(_cairo_surface_fill_rectangles):
	(_cairo_surface_composite_trapezoids): Absorb all functionality
	previously in the Xc library.

	* src/cairo_pen.c (_cairo_pen_init): Don't store floating point
	theta in the pen. Instead, sort vertices by fixed point slope
	comparisons.
	(_cairo_pen_add_points): Fixed to remove duplicate pen vertices
	appearing at beginning and end of vertex array.
	(_pen_vertex_compare): New fixed-point "angle" comparison for pen
	vertices. A bit trickier than before, but much more accurate.

	* src/cairo_path_stroke.c (_cairo_stroker_face_clockwise): Share
	clockwise calculation with other modules.

	* src/cairo_path_bounds.c:
	* src/cairo_path_fill.c:
	* src/cairo_path_stroke.c:
	* src/cairo_pen.c:
	* src/cairo_polygon.c:
	* src/cairo_spline.c:
	* src/cairo_traps.c:
	* src/cairo_path.c: Replaced all references to
	XFixed, XPointFixed, XLineFixed, and XTrapezoid with new
	cairo_fixed_t, cairo_point_t, cairo_line_t, and cairo_trapezoid_t.

	* src/cairo_path.c: (_cairo_path_interpret): Made the path
	interpreter callback names consistent, (eg. add_edge rather than
	AddEdge).

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_text_extents): Now silently
	exits for a non X surface, (avoids a crash until we can implement
	the libic text backend).

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_end_group):
	(_cairo_gstate_clip_and_composite_trapezoids):
	(_cairo_gstate_show_surface): Replaced all XcCalls with
	corresponding cairo_surface_calls.

	* src/cairo_gstate.c (_cairo_gstate_transform_point):
	(_cairo_gstate_transform_font):
	(_cairo_gstate_text_extents): Renamed from the garbled names
	(eg. cairo_gstateransform_point) leftover from the great renaming.

	* src/cairo_color.c (_cairo_color_set_rgb): Reworked cairo_color_t
	to eliminate reference to an XcColor object.

	* src/cairo.h: Dropped include of <Xc.h>, added
	<X11/extensions/Xrender.h>, <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>, and <ic.h>

	* src/cairo.c (cairo_get_fill_rule): Added missing cairo_get_fill_rule.

	* configure.in (PKG_CHECK_MODULES): Drops xc, add libic

	* cairo.pc.in (Requires): Drop xc, add libic.

2003-07-25  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_traps.c (_line_segs_intersect_ceil): We don't need a
	loop here, (just a conditional increment). This time, we've
	actually done the error analysis to back this up.

2003-07-24  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_traps.c (cairo_traps_tessellate_polygon): Massive
	cleanup of polygon tessellation, (it might actually be correct
	now).

2003-07-23  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairoint.h: Introduced some cairo_fixed_*_t types. This is
	the first baby step toward ripping X dependencies out of the Cairo
	headers.

	* src/cairo_traps.c (_compute_x): Converted from floating point to
	fixed point.
	(_line_seg_intersection_ceil): Now increments y value once if the
	initial y value computed is less than the actual intersection
	point.

	* src/cairo_traps.c (_compare_cairo_edge_by_slope): Converted from
	floating point to fixed point.

	* src/cairo_pen.c (_slope_clockwise): Converted from floating
	point to fixed point.

2003-07-19  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo_traps.c (cairo_traps_tessellate_polygon): Fixed some
	sorting problems with two intersections very near the same
	vertical position. (There are still some reamining problems
	though).
	(cairo_traps_tessellate_polygon): Better fix for the same
	bug. Should cover all cases, (and it's moe efficient too).

2003-07-18  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/cairo.h: Fixed some inconsistent tag/typedef names that were
	missed in the great renaming.

2003-07-18  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/cairo.h: Renamed everything from Xr* to cairo_*.

	* util/xr2cairo: Added utility script xr2cairo to help users fix
	their source code.

2003-07-03  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xrmatrix.c (XrMatrixGetAffine): Added XrMatrixGetAffine
	(from Soorya Kuloor)

	* src/xr.c (XrGetAlpha): Added XrGetAlpha
	(XrGetRGBColor): Added XrGetRGBColor

2003-06-12  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xrgstate.c (_XrGStateScale): Scale by 0 now causes an
	InvalidMatrix error.

2003-05-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xrmatrix.c (XrMatrixMultiply): Eliminated
	_XrMatrixMultiplyIntoRight and _XrMatrixMultiplyIntoLeft.

	* src/xrgstate.c (_XrGStateClipAndCompositeTrapezoids): Fixed
	missing translation of clip surface.

	* src/Xr.h: Added XrSurfacePutImage

2003-05-16  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xrint.h: Added ppm filed (pixels per meter) to both
	XrSurface and XrGState.

	* src/xrgstate.c (_XrGStateSetTargetSurface): Fixup CTM according
	to change in surface->ppm.
	(_XrGStateDefaultMatrix): Default matrix is no longer an identity
	matrix, but rather a matrix that provides some relates user space
	units to real-world dimensions in a meaningful way, (default 3780
	user space units per meter). This conversion is not exact, but is
	rather as close as possible while also guaranteeing that one user
	space unit maps to an integer number of device pixels.

2003-05-15  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xr.c (XrSetTargetDrawable): Moved implementation up from
	_XrGStateSetTargetDrawable, (eg. all convenience functions should
	be taken care of at the xr.c level ratehr than xrgstate.c)

	* src/Xr.h: Added convenience function XrSetTargetImage

2003-05-14  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xrfont.c (_XrFontResolveXftFont): Fixed fonts to pull
	pixelsize out of the transformation matrix. Fonts are now properly
	hinted regardless of scaling.

	* src/Xr.h: Three new functions for manipulating surfaces:
	XrSurfaceSetMatrix, XrSurfaceGetMatrix, XrSurfaceSetFilter.

	* src/Xr.h: Removed broken XrShowImage* functions. Changed
	XrShowSurface to not require X/Y but instead depend on the CTM for
	translation, (or the surface transformation matrix). I'd like to
	get rid of width/height as well but it turns out an XrSurface is
	not aware of its dimensions.

	* src/Xr.h: Added convenience function for building rectangular
	paths: XrRectangle.

	* src/Xr.h: Added functions for performing transformations with
	the CTM and its inverse: XrTransformPoint, XrTransformDistance,
	XrInverseTransformPoint, XrInverseTransformDistance.

	* src/Xr.h: XrConcatMatrix and XrSetMatrix now accept a pointer to
	an XrMatrix rather than 6 doubles.

	* src/Xr.h: Now exporting opaque XrMatrix object with several
	functions: XrMatrixCreate, XrMatrixDestroy, XrMatrixCopy,
	XrMatrixSetIdentity, XrMatrixSetAffine, XrMatrixTranslate,
	XrMatrixScale, XrMatrixRotate, XrMatrixInvert, XrMatrixMultiply,
	XrMatrixTransformDistance, XrMatrixTransformPoint.

2003-05-12  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/Xr.h: Added XrSetPattern. See also XrSurfaceSetRepeat.

	* src/xrpathbounds.c (_XrPathBounds): Moved path bound computation
	to its own file.

	* src/xrpathstroke.c (_XrPathStrokeToTraps): Moved path stroking
	to its own file.
	
	* src/xrpathfill.c (_XrPathFillToTraps): Moved path fililng to its
	own file.

	* src/xrgstate.c (_XrGStateStroke):
	(_XrGStateFill):
	(_XrGStateClipAndCompositeTrapezoids): Reorganized stroke and fill
	code to go through the same path for clipping.
	
2003-05-02  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* src/Xr.h: Changed XrFormatRGB32 to XrFormatRGB24

	* src/xrsurface.c (_XrFormatBPP, XrSurfaceCreateForImage)
	(_XrFormatDepth): Fixed for change of XrFormatRGB32 to
	XrFormatRGB24

2003-05-01  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xrpath.c (_XrPathBounderInit):
	(_XrPathBounderDeinit):
	(_XrPathBounderAddPoint):
	(_XrPathBounderAddEdge):
	(_XrPathBounderAddSpline):
	(_XrPathBounderDoneSubPath):
	(_XrPathBounderDonePath):
	(_XrPathBounds): New support for computing the bounding box of a
	path. Currently used internally, (for computing the size of the
	clip surface), and not exported publically.
	
	* src/xrgstate.c (_XrGStateStroke): Implemented clip support for
	strokes.
	(_XrGStateClip): New _XrGStateClip function fills the current path
	onto the gstate->clip surface.

	* src/xr.c (XrClip): Added preliminary/experimental clip
	functionality. The current implementation only clips stroked
	elements, (not fills, images, or text). It's alway quite
	inefficeient.

	* src/xr.c (XrGetOperator): 
	(XrGetTolerance): 
	(XrGetLineWidth): 
	(XrGetLineCap): 
	(XrGetLineJoin): 
	(XrGetMiterLimit): 
	(XrGetCurrentPoint): Added several new query functions.

2003-04-26  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* src/xrsurface.c (XrSurfaceDestroy): Fix memory leak of
	surface->image_data.

2003-04-25  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* configure.in: Fixed libtool versioning

2003-04-17  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* Switched from imake to autotools.

	* src/xrint.h: XrSurface structure is now greatly simplified,
	(details now handled by XcSurface).

	* src/Xr.h: Eliminated Display * parameter so Xr can be used for
	non-X drawing.
	Removed XrPushGroup/XrPopGroup.
	Replaced XrSetDrawable/XrSetVisual with XrSetTargetDrawable.
	Added XrSetTargetSurface and several new XrSurfaceCreate
	functions.	
	Added XrShowSurface, (functionality overlaps with XrShowImage --
	need to fix this)
	

2003-02-14  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateShowImageTransform): Fixed transformed
	images which were sometimes 1 pixel too tall/wide.

2003-02-06  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrpen.c (_XrPenVerticesNeeded): Fixed to use determinant rather
	than eigenvalues to compute maximal scaling of radius. Now avoids
	embarrassing segfaults due to NaN from the eigenvalue computation.

2003-01-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrtraps.c (_XrTrapsTessellateTriangle): Fixed to not re-order
	the array provided as an argument. (Note: the rectangle and
	polyghon tessellators still perform reordering).

	* xrstroker.c (_XrStrokerJoin):
	(_XrStrokerCap): Implemented round caps and joins.
	(_XrStrokerDoneSubPath): Fixed initial cap, (was always being
	drawn on the inside previously).

	* xrpen.c (_XrPenInit): Fixed to keep pen vertex theta values all
	in device space.
	(_XrPenAddPoints): Removed the silly flags from the pen vertices,
	(in favor of just using the FindActiveVertex functions)
	(_XrPenFindActiveCWVertexIndex):
	(_XrPenFindActiveCCWVertexIndex): Added functions needed for round
	caps/joins.

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateSetDash): Fixed to accept a NULL dash array
	to revert to no dashing.

2003-01-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* xrtraps.c (_XrTrapsTessellateTriangle): Restored triangle
	tessellation functionality, (I think it's correct this time).

	* xrstroker.c (_XrStrokerJoin): Bevel joins now use triangle
	tessellation rather than polygon tessellation.

2003-01-24  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* xrpolygon.c (_XrPolygonAddEdge): Fixed to handle multiple
	sub-polygons.

	* xrstroker.c (_XrStrokerJoin): Fixed handling of miter limit.

	* local.def: Added local.def for building outside the xc tree.

2002-12-03  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrstroker.c (_XrStrokerJoin):
	(_XrStrokerCap): Fixed to track change in winding rule parameter
	to XrTrapsTessellatePolygon, (otherwise self-intersecting splines
	suddenly had holes).

	* xrpen.c (_XrPenStrokeSpline): Fixed to track change in winding
	rule parameter to XrTrapsTessellatePolygon.

2002-11-11  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrtransform.c (_XrTransformBoundingBox): Added support for
	transforming a bounding box, (an axis-aligned rectangle prior to
	transformation). The ShowImage support needs this.
	(_XrTransformComputeInverse): Now catches error case for
	non-invertible matrix.

	* xrsurface.c (_XrSurfaceSetTransform): Fixed ordering of matrix
	for call to RenderSetPictureTransform

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateSetMatrix): 
	(_XrGStateIdentityMatrix): Support for new Xr matrix functions.
	(_XrGStateShowImage): 
	(_XrGStateShowImageTransform): Fixed transformation of images.

	* xr.c (XrSetMatrix): 
	(XrDefaultMatrix): 
	(XrIdentityMatrix): Added 3 matrix manipulation functions.

2002-11-04  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrsurface.c (_XrSurfaceDereference):
	(_XrSurfaceDereferenceDestroy): Fixed bug in reference counting
	logic.
	(_XrSurfaceSetDrawableWH): XrSurface now keeps track of its width/height.
	(_XrSurfaceGetDrawable): 
	(_XrSurfaceGetWidth): 
	(_XrSurfaceGetHeight): 
	(_XrSurfaceGetDepth): New accessor functions.

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateBeginGroup):
	(_XrGStateEndGroup): Preliminary group support. Not too efficient
	since it always composite's a full-size picture from child group
	to parent picture, (even if only a small portion has
	non-transparent pixels).
	(_XrGStateShowImageTransform): Fixed show image to use current
	alpha value.

	* xrfont.c (_XrFontResolveXftFont): Fixed memory leak
	(FcPatternDestroy). There's still some meory
	leaking/left-reachable in Xft/fontconfig that I need to track
	down.

	* xr.c (XrPushGroup):
	(XrPopGroup): Added preliminary group support. I think I like
	having this in the API as it takes several burdens away from the
	user, (plus it matches the PDF model). Things to do still: think
	about the names of these functions. Re-read the PDF semantics to
	see if we're missing anything.

	* xrsurface.c (_XrSurfaceSetImage): Fixed leak of the image
	pixmap.

2002-11-01  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* xrsurface.c (_XrSurfaceSetImage): Prelimary image
	support. Really only works with ARGB32. I still need to think
	about what formats will be supported.
	(_XrSurfaceSetTransform): Partial support for transformed
	surfaces.
	(_XrSurfaceGetXcSurface): Moved all creation/destruction of the
	XcSurface into this function so that it is only lazily created
	when needed.

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateSetCurrentPt): gstate now can throw errors
	when an operation needs current point, but it doesn't exist yet.
	(_XrGStateShowImage, _XrGStateShowImageTransform): Preliminary
	image support, (currently it only scales according to the CTM. The
	matrix passed with the image doesn't do anything yet.)

	* xrfont.c (_XrFontInitCopy): Removed bogus out of memory errors.

	* xr.c (XrShowImage, XrShowImageTransform): Added very preliminary
	image support. Things don't work completely yet and all the
	interfaces are likely to change.
	(XrGetStatusString): Added function to map status values to strings.

2002-10-31  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrfont.c (_XrFontInit):
	(_XrFontInitCopy):
	(_XrFontDeinit):
	(_XrFontSelect):
	(_XrFontResolveXftFont): Updated by ripping all font support from
	Xc and just putting a couple of calls to Xft and fontconfig right
	here in xrfont.

	* xr.c (XrTextExtents): Added XrTextExtents.

2002-10-29  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateSelectFont, _XrGStateScaleFont)
	(_XrGStateTransformFont, _XrGStateShowText): Added basic font
	support.

	* xr.c (XrSelectFont, XrScaleFont, XrTransformFont): Added basic
	font support.

2002-10-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* xrstate.c (_XrStatePop): Added error case for XrRestore without
	matching XrSave.

	* xrsurface.c (_XrSurfaceInit, _XrSurfaceReference)
	(_XrSurfaceDereference): Added reference counting to XrSurface to
	patch a memory leak.

2002-10-26  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrtransform.c (_XrTransformDistance):
	(_XrTransformPoint): changed to use individual X/Y arguments
	rather tha an XPointDouble. This improves readability since
	_XrTransformDistance is now always called with arguments of dx/dy
	rather than pt.x/pt.y.

	* xrpath.c (_XrPathMoveTo):
	(_XrPathLineTo):
	(_XrPathCurveTo):
	(_XrPathClosePath): replaced public _XrPathAdd with explicit named
	functions. This cleans up the implementation since _XrPathAdd,
	which is unsafe with respect to argument consistency, is now
	private. Also, since the _XrGState now maintains the current
	point, I dropped all relative path operators from the XrPath data
	structures.

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateMoveTo):
	(_XrGStateLineTo):
	(_XrGStateCurveTo):
	(_XrGStateRelMoveTo):
	(_XrGStateRelLineTo):
	(_XrGStateRelCurveTo): Replaces _XrGStateAddPathOp and
	_XrGStateAddUnaryPathOp with explicit named functions for each
	operator type. This change introduces the current point state into
	the XrGState structure rather than postponing its calculation
	until path interpretation.

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateSetDrawable):
	(_XrGStateSetVisual):
	(_XrGStateSetFormat):
	(_XrGStateSetOperator):
	(_XrGStateSetRGBColor):
	(_XrGStateSetTolerance):
	(_XrGStateSetAlpha):
	(_XrGStateSetFillRule):
	(_XrGStateSetLineWidth):
	(_XrGStateSetLineCap):
	(_XrGStateSetLineJoin):
	(_XrGStateSetMiterLimit):
	(_XrGStateTranslate):
	(_XrGStateScale):
	(_XrGStateRotate):
	(_XrGStateConcatMatrix):
	(_XrGStateNewPath): : Added XrStatus return values to many
	functions -- just for consistency, these functions can not return
	errors in any case.

	* xr.c (XrShowText): Started to ass XrShowText, (still not functional)

2002-10-24  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xr.c (XrSetFillRule): Added support to set fill rule.

2002-10-23  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* xrtraps.c (_XrTrapsTessellatePolygon): Fix for polygon with
	multiple sub-polygons that are disjoint in Y.

2002-07-16  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* Xr.h: Renamed xrpicture.c to xrsurface.c as part of the move.
	Added XrSetFormat, XrSetOperator, XrSetLineCap, XrSetLineJoin, and
	XrSetMiterLimit, (although the line style drawing code is not all
	in place yet).

	* xrpath.c (XrPathLineTo): Changed LineTo semantics to be the same
	as MoveTo if there was no previous MoveTo.

	* xrtraps.c: Added tessellation code, (lifted from
	XRenderCompositeDoublePoly which can now disappear).

	* xrgstate.c: Changed stroke code to incrementally build a list of
	trapezoids rather than forming one giant polygonal outline and
	rendering that. This should be more efficient.
	(_XrGStateFillPath): Now uses Xr's own tessellation along with
	XcCompositeTrapezoids.

	* Xr.h: Moved all of Xr away from Xrender to the new Xc library.

	* xrsurface.c: Renamed from xrpicture.c, (part of the move from
	XRender to Xc).

	* Started keeping a ChangeLog ;-)
